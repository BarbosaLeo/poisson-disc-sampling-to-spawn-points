# poisson disc sampling to spawn points
 A static class to generate points and a spawner to place objects within some value range.
 
 + The SpawnPoints Class was not created by me, but I slighly modified it to fit my project.
 
 + TreeSpawn is a class to spawn gameObjects in the scene based on the raycast hit points. I used it to spawn trees in a game but it should be renamed to something more generic.
